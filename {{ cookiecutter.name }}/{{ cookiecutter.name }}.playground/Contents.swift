/***
 # Scratch Pad

 A Playground for creating components using {{ cookiecutter.name }} framework. 
 Using the playground allows for a faster feedback loop and
 for the developer to be able to stage states without going through the
 normal flow of the application.

 iPad Window is setup to display at 3/4 scale (I was unable to get the
 playgrounds view to display at fullscale).

 This file has been ignored, just checkout to reset to a clean slate.
